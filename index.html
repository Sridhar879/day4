    <p>Kohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, whom he regarded as the epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar's "successor",[19][20] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the future.[21][22] His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, whom he idolized in his formative years and sought to emulate, is well-documented. Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar's style of batting, imitating his shots and attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[23] Kohli's aggressive and dynamic style has earned him accolades from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who has acknowledged Kohli's similarities to his own playing style.[24] He has been lauded as the "new king of world cricket" by Dean Jones, a former Australian cricketer.[25] While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has noted that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots,[26] Kohli's skills with the bat have earned him accolades from former West Indies great Brian Lara, who has ranked him among the best batsmen in the world alongside Joe Root, the England captain at the time.[27]

        In a discourse with the prominent Bollywood actor Salman Khan, Tendulkar proclaimed that Kohli possesses the potential to surpass his record of 100 international centuries. Tendulkar also acknowledged Kohli's batting aptitudes and the steadfastness with which he has accumulated runs.[28] In 2013, Tendulkar retired from international cricket, marking the end of an era for Indian cricket. Kohli, who played alongside Tendulkar in the team, honoured him by presenting him with a sacred thread that had been gifted to him by his late father. Tendulkar eventually returned the thread to him, imploring that it should remain in his possession.[29]
        
        Playing style
        Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic playing demeanour.[30][31] His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested stance,[32] and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure situations.[33][34] In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.[35][36]

        Kohli has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he considers to be his signature stroke. He possesses a natural aptitude for the flick shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards leg stump.[11] Having a limited recourse to the sweep shot, Kohli's batting technique is characterized by an emphasis on ground shots that primarily yield runs in the regions between deep square leg and mid-on.[37] Kohli is known for his composed batting technique and versatility in his play. He scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat, while also possessing the ability to display a destructive streak. His combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft innovative angles that disrupt traditional field positioning.[38] Kohli is also a proficient fielder, recognized for his quick reflexes and sure-handedness.[39]
        
        However, Kohli has a known vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump.[40] Bowlers often exploit this weakness by targeting him with such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches.[41] This vulnerability has resulted in Kohli's dismissal on numerous occasions.[42][43] Cricket experts such as VVS Laxman and former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar have acknowledged this weakness,[44][45] and former New Zealand cricketer Richard Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to out-swinging deliveries.[46]
        
        Kohli has garnered widespread acclaim and recognition as a preeminent limited-overs batsman by cricketing experts and aficionados alike.[47][48] In ODIs, he boasts an average of 65.5 runs when batting second and 51.7 runs when batting first.[49] He has amassed 27 of his 50 ODI hundreds in run-chases,[50] and holds the record for the most hundreds scored when batting second.[51] In reference to his success while batting second, Kohli has expressed a fondness for the challenge of chasing, relishing the opportunity to test himself and demonstrate his ability to efficiently manage strike rotation and execute boundary hits.[52] His colleagues admire his self-assurance, dedication, concentration, and work ethic, which are the driving forces behind his success.[53][54]</p>
    <h1 id="Agreion">Agression</h1>
    <p>Kohli's playing style is widely regarded as aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on the field. He is well known for his passionate and animated responses to on-field situations, demonstrating a fierce competitiveness.[55][56] His captaincy is characterized as proactive, taking bold decisions and leading the team by example.[57] Kohli has been the subject of much media scrutiny and criticism in the early stages of his career. He was often portrayed as a brash and arrogant individual, eliciting mixed reactions from fans, critics and former cricketers alike.[58][59] While some have praised his assertiveness and confidence,[60][61] others have criticized Kohli's behaviour for crossing the boundaries of fair play and for losing control, sometimes resulting in a loss of composure.[62] Despite his efforts to curb his aggressive behaviour, Kohli has acknowledged that there are times when intense pressure or high-stakes situations may challenge his resolve. The cricketer has persistently maintained that his aggression acts as a source of inspiration and drives his focus and motivation on the field.[63] Writing for The New York Times, Huw Richards noted Kohli's self-assuredness and "assertiveness" in contrast to some former Indian cricketers who he felt had exhibited an inclination towards excessive politeness and reticence, and that Kohli embodies his combative demeanour both on and off the cricket field.[64]</p>
